This is a fork of battleforthenet.com that is being used to push a more nuanced arguement that Title II is not the safe way to achieve net neutrality goals. It was made quickly and may break. If you've time and resources to improve it please reach out. The backend is being improved and will not be made public on this repository for secrutity purposes. If you'd like to look at it and help out please just contact me at pvanvalkeburgh@techfreedom.org, or via github.
